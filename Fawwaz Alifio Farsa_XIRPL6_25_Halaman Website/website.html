        <p>
          Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees,   or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and weapons, furniture and paper. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate.

          <img src="assets/ash.png"><h3>Ash</h3><p>Ash is a hardwood lumber that comes from a variety of trees, including black ash, green ash, white ash, and blue ash. With enough space, an ash tree can grow up to 60 feet tall and spread up to 80 feet wide.

            Ash lumber has a light color that varies between white and gold, with some gray streaks being common. The shades are similar to maple, but the texture is more oak-like, with a rougher surface. It’s very hard but lightweight compared to its strength and stiffness. It even offers a bit more shock resistance than other hardwoods. It stains and paints extremely well.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

Redwood trees are known as the tallest tree species in the world, growing up to 400 feet. These softwoods grow in a relatively small area of the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

          Redwood is very soft and workable, and it’s also lightweight. It ranges in color from pale white or yellow to deep red to reddish-brown. Growing as tall and quickly as these giants do, the grain is typically straight, with old-growth redwood grain being very tight. The wood has a rough texture, and it’s rot-resistant and very insect-resistant, making it a great choice for outdoor projects.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

These trees grow up to 70 feet tall but tend to stay thinly trunked. The most common variants of the birch tree are the white birch, yellow birch, and black birch.

          Birch wood tends to be smoothly and tightly grained, giving a relatively uniform appearance. It varies in color from white to yellow, with black birch commonly having some black streaks throughout. The wood is heavy, hard, and strong but responds very well to woodworking with sharp tools. It usually shrinks quite a bit as it dries.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

            When it comes to hardwoods for luxurious finishes and projects, mahogany tends to stand on its own (even over the gorgeous cherry wood). The wood tends to be a rich red or brown-red. Mahogany has a very smooth, tight grain and is extremely strong and resilient. It’s also very, very dense, making it both rot- and insect-resistant.
            
            One of mahogany’s best characteristics is that it’s very stable: It resists shrinking, swelling, and warping.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahogany" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

This wood comes from the teak tree, which is native to southern Asia but also grows on farms in Latin America, Africa, and other tropical regions.

            Teak is a generally straight-grained wood with a coarse and uneven texture. The wood consists of natural oils, which cause it to be very rot- and insect-resistant. Despite those oils, teak is easy to work with, both gluing and finishing nicely. In many ways, teak and mahogany are very similar, but teak is unmistakably brown, while mahogany often has a red hue.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teak" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

The trees are common throughout the Midwest and eastern United States, with commercial production coming mostly from the Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York areas.

            Cherry wood varies from creamy white to red to reddish-brown, and it darkens as it ages and dries. The grain is very straight and tight, giving cherry wood a uniform look and it mills very well. When stained and sealed, cherry produces one of the smoothest finishes available, giving it a very high-end look.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

          <img src="assets/pine.png"><h3>Pine</h3><p>Pine is a very soft wood that’s incredibly easy to work with. It comes from a variety of pine trees grown all over the United States. Common types include sugar, white, ponderosa, and southern yellow pine. It’s less dense than others and easy to work with, but it doesn’t tend to offer much bug or rot resistance.

            Pine has a pale or yellow appearance, depending on the exact species. It might also have its fair share of knots, with truly knotty pieces marketed as “knotty pine” and knot-free pieces as “clear pine.” It is rugged-looking, and it takes paint or stain very well.
            
            Lower-grade pine from home stores can be susceptible to cupping or warping. All pine typically has a naturally high moisture content, and the cheaper cuts buckle and twist as they dry.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

          <img src="assets/fir.png"><h3>Fir</h3><p>Fir, or Douglas fir, is a very hard and durable softwood, and it comes from a tree species of the same name. Douglas fir trees grow very tall, reaching heights of 200 to 300 feet if left to their own devices in the forest. The wood is rot- and insect-resistant, but not quite to the degree of a cedar.
            
          Douglas fir has a very pronounced grain, and it usually runs rather straight. The wood has a reddish-tan coloring, and it’s not particularly good at accepting stains evenly. Because of the grain pattern and density (it’s a heavy wood), nails driven into Douglas fir tend to stay put. It’s also relatively inexpensive. All of these characteristics make it an excellent choice for construction lumber, though DIYers also use it for decking and some woodworking projects.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

            The hardwood that a rock maple produces is very dense and tough, with a wonderful lightly-colored appearance that varies between white, yellow, and a rich golden color. The grain is relatively tight and straight, and tends to show in light brown bands. There also is curly maple, which has interesting wavy grain patterns. Both grain types produce a smooth, fine texture that finishes very nicely.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

            Oak comes in two common varieties: white and red. Both are very dense and tough, with straight-grained, rough textures. Red oak has a redder hue, while white oak is lighter in color, ranging from white to a pale yellow. White oak is famous for its “fleck,” which is a wavy, contrasting pattern revealed during the sawing process. Oak is rot- and bug-resistant, and though it’s very durable, it tends to bend well. It also takes stain very well, but will show grain through several coats of paint.<br><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>
